# How to generate the game's spritesheet

1. Go to [Stitches](https://draeton.github.io/stitches/).

2. Make sure there are 64 images (not including this guide). If there are not, duplicate the empty placeholder until you do.

3. Drag all files inside [this folder](../spritesheet%20512/) and upload them, except this guide.

4. Make sure they are in the correct order.

5. Decrease the padding to 0px.
