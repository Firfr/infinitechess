Update 1.4 is released! There have been many collaborative features added since we open sourced!

- Knightriders have been added, which hop infinitely like a knight until they're obstructed! The 'Knighted Chess' variant has been upgraded to replace the knights with knightriders!
- Click your or your opponent's pieces at any time to view their possible moves!
- Right-click at any time to deselect the currently selected piece.
- Hovering over arrow indicators on the edge of the screen now renders the legal moves of the piece they are pointing to!
- The game now automatically declares a draw if there's insufficient material on the board to force checkmate.
- Translated the website into French! You can change the language by visiting the footer on any page.
- Improved the loading time of the website.
- New website icon, Î©! This automatically matches your preferred light or dark device theme.
- The game code's, or the ICN's, metadata has been reformatted to more closely match PGN norms.
